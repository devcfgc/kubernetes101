The first stage of launching the application is to start the Redis Master.
A Kubernetes service deployment has, at least, two parts.
A replication controller and a service.

The replication controller defines how many instances should be running,
the Docker Image to use, and a name to identify the service.
Additional options can be utilized for configuration and discovery.
Use the editor above to view the YAML definition.

If Redis were to go down, the replication controller would restart it on
an active node.

1) kubectl create -f redis-master-controller.yaml
2) kubectl create -f redis-master-service.yaml
3) kubectl create -f redis-slave-service.yaml
4) kubectl create -f frontend-controller.yaml
